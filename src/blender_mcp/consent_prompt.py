"""First-run telemetry consent prompt.

Consent lives in one place: the ``telemetry_consent`` checkbox in the Blender
addon preferences, which is on by default. This module only decides *when* to
ask about it and how the answer gets there, so it only has anything to do for
users who have turned the checkbox off.

Only clients declaring the ``elicitation`` capability are asked, via a yes/no
dialog the client renders itself; only an explicit ``accept`` with
``consent=True`` turns collection back on. Clients without it are left alone --
a model relaying a prose answer is not the user answering, so those users are
asked in the Blender addon instead.

Asked at most once per conversation. A decline is remembered on disk so it is
not re-asked on every future conversation.
